If you have docker installed you can spin up MySQL DB with `docker compose up`

After running the project feel free to check endpoints created in lab assignments like:

- http://localhost:8000/api/categories/ GET
- http://localhost:8000/api/categories/ POST (as manager)
- http://localhost:8000/api/cart/menu-items/ GET
- http://localhost:8000/api/menu-items/?per_page=10 GET
